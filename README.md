# London bus
[https://github.com/saladlam/london-bus](https://github.com/saladlam/london-bus)

## Objective
TfL Go app is a good application for enquiring about the coming bus/train at a particular station/bus stop. But sometimes it is useful for knowing the current location of a bus so that it can be estimated the actual arrival time in rush hour. So I made this.

## Function
Show bus stops and buses approaching which bus stop of a bus route at time of queuing. Live example is in [here](http://londonbus.saladlam.info/).

## Main component used
- Bootstrap 4.1.X
- Popper.js 1.14.X
- jQuery 3.6.X

## Source of bus data
This application is powered by [TfL Open Data](https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/terms-and-conditions/transport-data-service).
